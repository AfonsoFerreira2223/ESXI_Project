# Router configuration:


You can go to root as most commands here require high-level permissions

```
su -
```

## -----------------------------


### At any point during installations:

It may ask you to insert the CD-ROM in order to download the packages

Go to esxi- edit- then pick the connect box on the datastore iso section (this is where the package is included)


![image](https://github.com/AfonsoFerreira2223/ESXI_Project/assets/114146560/1a186dad-89c3-46d4-a66b-09bd58600d5a)


### Configuring the router:


First of all, make sure you can download packages:

```
apt-cdrom add
```

Now go to


```
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

And allow the machine to trust packages from the cd-rom by adding ```[trusted=yes]```


For example:

```
# deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 11.7.0 _Bullseye_ - Official amd64 BD Binary-1 20230429-11:50]/ bullseye contrib main

deb [trusted=yes] cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 11.7.0 _Bullseye_ - Official amd64 BD Binary-4 20230429-11:50]/ bullseye contrib main
deb [trusted=yes] cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 11.7.0 _Bullseye_ - Official amd64 BD Binary-3 20230429-11:50]/ bullseye contrib main
deb [trusted=yes] cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 11.7.0 _Bullseye_ - Official amd64 BD Binary-2 20230429-11:50]/ bullseye contrib main
deb [trusted=yes] cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 11.7.0 _Bullseye_ - Official amd64 BD Binary-1 20230429-11:50]/ bullseye contrib main

deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib
deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib

# bullseye-updates, to get updates before a point release is made;
# see https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html#_updates_and_backports
# A network mirror was not selected during install.  The following entries
# are provided as examples, but you should amend them as appropriate
# for your mirror of choice.
#
# deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main contrib
# deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye-updates main contrib
```



Now update the machine



```
apt update
apt upgrade

```


## -----------------------------


Configuring the interfaces on the router:

```
nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Once you are here, copy and paste this (alter the Ip addresses to suit your defined ranges):



<details>
  <summary>Network Interfaces Configuration</summary>

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug ens192
iface ens192 inet static
        address 192.168.15.173/24
        gateway 192.168.15.1
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
        dns-search enta.pt

# Inside network interface
allow-hotplug ens224
iface ens224 inet static
        address 192.168.31.1/24
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-search enta.pt

# DMZ network interface
allow-hotplug ens256
iface ens256 inet static
        address 172.31.0.1/24
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-search enta.pt
```

</details>


## -----------------------------

```
systemctl restart networking
reboot
ip a
```


Your interfaces should now have the respective IP add assigned to them

![Captura de ecrÃ£ de 2023-06-22 10-03-27](https://github.com/AfonsoFerreira2223/ESXI_Project/assets/114146560/a7e9c44d-a21c-444c-8887-fbd67bd0335a)


Make sure to note down the MAC addresses of your interfaces and match them with the correct IP addresses in the ESXi configuration.


Enable IP forwarding by editing the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file. Uncomment the following line:

> net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


Then verify the changes by running the command:
```
sysctl -p
```


## DHCP:


Install the DHCP server package by running the following command:


```
apt install -y isc-dhcp-server
```

Edit the DHCP server configuration file `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`. Change the domain name to your desired value using the following line:

```
option domain-name "your_domain_name";
```

Specify the IP addresses of the domain name servers and interfaces by adding the following line:
```
option domain-name-servers (YOUR IP addresses);
```

Add the HMAC-MD5 key for secure DHCP updates by inserting the following lines:

```
key DHCP_UPDATER {
    algorithm HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT;
    secret "pRP5FapFoJ95JEL06sv4PQ==";
};
```


This is an example of my configuration


```
subnet 192.168.31.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.31.128 192.168.31.191;
  option routers 192.168.31.1;
  option broadcast-address 192.168.31.255;
}

subnet 172.31.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 172.31.0.64 172.31.0.95;
  option routers 172.31.0.1;
  option broadcast-address 172.31.0.255;
}

host 172.31.0.64 {
  hardware ethernet 00:50:56:86:13:6f;
  fixed-address 172.31.0.64;
  option routers 172.31.0.1;
  option broadcast-address 172.31.0.255;
}

zone enta.pt {
         primary 127.0.0.1;
         key DHCP_UPDATER;
}

zone 31.172.in-addr.arpa. {
         primary 127.0.0.1;
         key DHCP_UPDATER;
}

zone 31.168.192.in-addr.arpa. {
         primary 127.0.0.1;
         key DHCP_UPDATER;
}


```


Open the `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server` file and add the interfaces you want the DHCP server to listen on. Modify the following line:


```
INTERFACESv4="(Include the names of your desired interfaces)"
```

In this case, I am using interfaces ens192, 224 and 256





## Configuring NFtables

```
nano /etc/nftables.conf
```

Configure the nftables appropriately

An example would be:

```
table ip filter {
        chain INPUT {
                type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop;
                iifname "lo" counter packets 14 bytes 1160 accept

## DNS

```
apt install bind9 bind9-dnsutils bind9-doc bind9-utils bind9utils
```


Now that bind9 is installed, create the following files inside the directory (you can use nano as a text editor)

> enta.pt will be the domain used here

```
cd /etc/var/cache
```

```
nano db.enta.pt
```

```

cd /etc/easy-rsa/
cp vars.example vars
nano vars

Once you open vars, do the following changes:

> Change set_var EASYRSA_DN "cn_only" to "org"

![Captura de ecrÃ£ de 2023-06-22 12-14-47](https://github.com/AfonsoFerreira2223/ESXI_Project/assets/114146560/fbba8a6b-cb70-43ab-a463-aa2bd16213b8)


Set the variables according to your domain


Now to create the certificates run the following commands


```
cd /etc/easy-rsa/
./easyrsa --subject-alt-name="DNS:smtp.enta.pt" gen-req smtp.enta.pt nopass
./easyrsa --subject-alt-name="DNS:pop.enta.pt" gen-req pop.enta.pt nopass
./easyrsa --subject-alt-name="DNS:smtp.enta.pt" sign-req server smtp.enta.pt nopass
./easyrsa --subject-alt-name="DNS:pop.enta.pt" sign-req server pop.enta.pt nopass
cd pki/issued/
cp pop.enta.pt.crt /etc/ssl/crts
cp smtp.enta.pt.crt /etc/ssl/crts
cd ../private/
cp pop.enta.pt.key /etc/ssl/private/
cp smtp.enta.pt.key /etc/ssl/private/
chown -R root:ssl-cert /etc/ssl/private/pop.enta.pt.key
apt-get install exim4-daemon-heavy sasl2-bin dovecot-pop3d dovecot-imapd easy-rsa
cd ..
cd ..
addgroup --system ssl-cert
addgroup --system ssl-cert

chmod 440 /etc/ssl/private/*
adduser Debian-exim ssl-cert
adduser Debian-exim sasl
adduser dovecot ssl-cert
dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
```


Now open these files with a text editor, and copy paste the following configurations (change the domain names values accordingly)



```
nano /etc/default/saslauthd
```

```

## Mailbox locations and namespaces
##

# Location for users' mailboxes. The default is empty, which means that Dovecot
# tries to find the mailboxes automatically. This won't work if the user
# doesn't yet have any mail, so you should explicitly tell Dovecot the full
# location.
#
# If you're using mbox, giving a path to the INBOX file (eg. /var/mail/%u)
# isn't enough. You'll also need to tell Dovecot where the other mailboxes are
# kept. This is called the "root mail directory", and it must be the first
# path given in the mail_location setting.
#
# There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if there's no domain
#   %h - home directory
#
# See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for full list. Some examples:
#
   mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
#   mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
#   mail_location = mbox:/var/mail/%d/%1n/%n:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%1n/%n
#
# <doc/wiki/MailLocation.txt>
#
#mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u

# If you need to set multiple mailbox locations or want to change default
# namespace settings, you can do it by defining namespace sections.
#
# You can have private, shared and public namespaces. Private namespaces
# are for user's personal mails. Shared namespaces are for accessing other
# users' mailboxes that have been shared. Public namespaces are for shared
# mailboxes that are managed by sysadmin. If you create any shared or public
# namespaces you'll typically want to enable ACL plugin also, otherwise all
# users can access all the shared mailboxes, assuming they have permissions
# on filesystem level to do so.
namespace inbox {
  # Namespace type: private, shared or public

  # Hierarchy separator to use. You should use the same separator for all
  # namespaces or some clients get confused. '/' is usually a good one.

  # parts, these rules disallow certain non-alphanumeric characters, as
  # a precaution.

  # Empty components (two dots in a row) are not valid in RFC 2822, but Exim
  # allows them because they have been encountered. (Consider local parts
  # constructed as "firstinitial.secondinitial.familyname" when applied to
  # a name without a second initial.) However, a local part starting
  # with a dot or containing /../ can cause trouble if it is used as part of a
  # file name (e.g. for a mailing list). This is also true for local parts that
  # contain slashes. A pipe symbol can also be troublesome if the local part is
  # incorporated unthinkingly into a shell command line.
  #
  # These ACL components will block recipient addresses that are valid
  # from an RFC5322 point of view. We chose to have them blocked by
  # default for security reasons.

# This router handles forwarding using traditional .forward files in users'
# home directories. It also allows mail filtering with a forward file
# starting with the string "# Exim filter" or "# Sieve filter".
#
# The no_verify setting means that this router is skipped when Exim is
# verifying addresses. Similarly, no_expn means that this router is skipped if
# Exim is processing an EXPN command.
#
# The check_ancestor option means that if the forward file generates an
# address that is an ancestor of the current one, the current one gets
# passed on instead. This covers the case where A is aliased to B and B
# has a .forward file pointing to A.
#
# The four transports specified at the end are those that are used when
# forwarding generates a direct delivery to a directory, or a file, or to a
# pipe, or sets up an auto-reply, respectively.

#################################

# The examples below are for server side authentication, when the
# local exim is SMTP server and clients authenticate to the local exim.

# They allow two styles of plain-text authentication against an
# CONFDIR/passwd file whose syntax is described in exim4_passwd(5).

# Hosts that are allowed to use AUTH are defined by the
# auth_advertise_hosts option in the main configuration. The default is
# "*", which allows authentication to all hosts over all kinds of
# connections if there is at least one authenticator defined here.
# Authenticators which rely on unencrypted clear text passwords don't
# advertise on unencrypted connections by default. Thus, it might be
# wise to set up TLS to allow encrypted connections. If TLS cannot be
# used for some reason, you can set AUTH_SERVER_ALLOW_NOTLS_PASSWORDS to
# advertise unencrypted clear text password based authenticators on all
# connections. As this is severely reducing security, using TLS is
# preferred over allowing clear text password based authenticators on
# unencrypted connections.

# PLAIN authentication has no server prompts. The client sends its
# credentials in one lump, containing an authorization ID (which we do not
# use), an authentication ID, and a password. The latter two appear as
# $auth2 and $auth3 in the configuration and should be checked against a
# valid username and password. In a real configuration you would typically
# use $auth2 as a lookup key, and compare $auth3 against the result of the
# lookup, perhaps using the crypteq{}{} condition.

# plain_server:
#   driver = plaintext
#   public_name = PLAIN
#   server_condition = "${if crypteq{$auth3}{${extract{1}{:}{${lookup{$auth2}lsearch{CONFDIR/passwd}{$value}{*:*}}}}}{1}{0}}"
#   server_set_id = $auth2
#   server_prompts = :
#   .ifndef AUTH_SERVER_ALLOW_NOTLS_PASSWORDS
#   server_advertise_condition = ${if eq{$tls_in_cipher}{}{}{*}}
#   .endif

# LOGIN authentication has traditional prompts and responses. There is no
# authorization ID in this mechanism, so unlike PLAIN the username and
# password are $auth1 and $auth2. Apart from that you can use the same
# server_condition setting for both authenticators.

# login_server:
#   driver = plaintext
#   public_name = LOGIN
#   server_prompts = "Username:: : Password::"
#   server_condition = "${if crypteq{$auth2}{${extract{1}{:}{${lookup{$auth1}lsearch{CONFDIR/passwd}{$value}{*:*}}}}}{1}{0}}"

# This one is a bad hack to support the broken version 4.xx of
# Microsoft Outlook Express which violates the RFCs by demanding
# "250-AUTH=" instead of "250-AUTH ".
# If your list of offered authenticators is other than PLAIN and LOGIN,
# you need to adapt the public_name line manually.
# It has to be the last authenticator to work and has not been tested
# well. Use at your own risk.

# http://www.exim.org/mail-archives/exim-users/Week-of-Mon-20050214/msg00213.html
